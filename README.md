## Happy Diwali 🪔

As we celebrate this Festival of Lights, let's illuminate our homes and kindle the flame of kindness in our hearts. 
Thank you for joining us in embracing the light of compassion and mindfulness towards all living beings.

## Why did we celebrate a vegan festival? 🍃
Despite most Indian festivals being celebrated with vegetarian food, we are celebrating a fully vegan festival. This is because vegans do not support commodification of animals and other animal derived products. We encourage a lifestyle that promotes animal rights.
